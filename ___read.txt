3. To run file, sh pathtofile/filename.sh for example if in same directory as file, sh ./filename.sh or just sh filename.sh
3. In variable no space is allowed around =, i.e varname = value isn't valid. Should be varname=value
4. If one wants to combined variables into one variable space isn't allowed too if they're not inside of the ""[quotes] i.e combined = $var1 $var2 isn't allowed as they have spaces. 
   if needs spaces, they should be put inside of the quote as : combined = "$var1 $var2" is valid as they're enclosed inside of the double quotes.
5.To take input from the user [bash] we use read command as read variable_name, variable_name is a readable name, didn't have to be declared already, ust use this name in accessing it.
